WP Meetup fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event.

== Description ==

Meetup is used by 9.5 million members who meet over 2,000 times every single day in local communities across the nation. Unfortunately, there hasn't been an efficient way to link an organization's Meetup events easily and efficiently to their WordPress site.

Until now.

Nuanced Media's WP Meetup plugin fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event. WP Meetup also provides an event calendar for displaying events, either on a page or as a widget.

New in version 2.0!

• Display multiple groups on one calendar, each group with their own color highlight. Perfect for organizers of multiple, related groups!
• Display multiple months of events, including past, present, and future events. Help your members plan ahead for special events!
• Calendar widget that displays a small calendar in the widget area, as well as a new widget that lists seven upcoming events.
• Increased database stability for calendar creation.

It has never been so easy to aggregate and display events.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-meetup.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the options page located at Settings -> WP Meetup and follow the instructions.
4. To include the event calendar on a page, create a new page and in the content editor, enter `[wp-meetup-calendar]` where you want the calendar to appear on the page.
5. To include a variable number of months on the event calender, use shortcode, e.g. `[wp-meetup-calendar number_of_months='4']` by default the calender displays two months (the current, and the next).
6. Starting with version 1.5.0, you now have the ability to show any number of previous and future events! Try, for example, [wp-meetup-calendar start_month=-2 end_month=2]. This will show a total of 4 months (2 previous months, and the next 2 months, all relative to the current month). Play around with it, it's great to be able to have this variable calendar showing!

Note: With version 2.0.0, shortcodes where added, e.g. `[meetup-calendar]` by default displays only the current month. The ability to display multiple months still exists, e.g. `[meetup-calendar past=1 future=2]` will display 4 months (1 previous month, the current month, and the next 2 months).

**Important: If you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, make sure to disable the plugin and re-enable it.**
